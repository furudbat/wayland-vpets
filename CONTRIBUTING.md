## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

See [Building from Source](README.md#-building-from-source) for detailed instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furudbat/wayland-vpets.git
cd wayland-vpets
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
````

> Legacy `make debug` is supported for old Bongo Cat workflows, or you can just use CMake.

## Code Standards

Follow the projectâ€™s coding guidelines:

* **Language**: C23 / C++23
* **Memory Safety**: Use RAII and leak-free practices [see system_memory.h](include/utils/system_memory.h)
* **Threading**: Proper synchronization, stop threads before cleanup
* **Modern C++**: Prefer `constexpr`, `enum class`, `ref&`, `nullptr`, move semantics
* **Try to avoid STL & Minimal Templates, you can use C functions and Linux build-in functions**
* **Assets**: Embed large assets in separate TUs
* **Global State**: Avoid globals, pass context structs

For more details, see the [Code Standards section in README](README.md#code-standards).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes following the code standards.
3. Test your changes thoroughly, including multi-monitor and keyboard input scenarios.
4. Commit your changes with clear messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add support for X feature"
   ```
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
6. Include a description of what your PR changes and any relevant screenshots or logs.

## Style Guidelines

* **Branch Naming**: `feature/xxx`, `bugfix/xxx`, `docs/xxx`
* **Commit Messages**: Use present tense, concise, and descriptive
* **Formatting**: try to Follow existing formatting and indentation, -- @TODO: add `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy`
* **Documentation**: Update relevant README sections if needed
  * when adding new configuration, pls update [`bongocat.conf`](bongocat.conf)
  * when adding new program arguments update [`cli_show_help` in main](src/core/main.cpp)
    * update [man pages](docs/fragments/options.md)
