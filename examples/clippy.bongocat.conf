# Animation settings
# idle_frame: Which frame to use when idle (0, 1, or 2)

# Options for MS Agent: 0 = idle 1, 1 = idle 2

# test_animation_interval: How often to trigger test animation (in seconds)
# Set to 0 to disable test animations

#DEPRECATED: use idle_animation and animation_speed (for non-bongocat)

# Frame rate settings
# fps: Animation frame rate (frames per second)
fps=15

# Input devices (you can specify multiple devices)
# Use keyboard_device for each device you want to monitor
# Examples:
keyboard_device=/dev/input/event4
# keyboard_device=/dev/input/event20  # External bluetooth keyboard (commented out - doesn't exist)
# keyboard_device=/dev/input/event5   # Another input device

# Multi-monitor support
# Specify which monitor to display bongocat on (optional)
# Use wlr-randr or swaymsg -t get_outputs to find monitor names
# If not specified or monitor not found, uses first available monitor
