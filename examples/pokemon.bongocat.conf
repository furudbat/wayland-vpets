# Bongo Cat Configuration File
# Edit these values to customize your bongo cat overlay

# Position settings (in pixels)
# cat_x_offset: Horizontal offset from center position
# When cat_align is "center": Positive values move right, negative values move left (default)
# When cat_align is "left": Positive values move right, negative values move left
# When cat_align is "right": Positive values move left, negative values move right

# Anti-aliasing settings
# enable_antialiasing: Use bilinear interpolation for smooth scaling ()0 = off, 1 = on)
# When enabled, provides smoother edges when scaling the cat image

# Size settings
# cat_height: Height of the bongo cat in pixels
# Width is automatically calculated to maintain aspect ratio

# NOTE: OVERLAY SETTINGS DOESN'T WORK WITH HOT RELOAD, NEEDS BONGOCAT RESTART

# NOTE: SPRITE LOADING SETTINGS DOESN'T WORK WITH HOT RELOAD, NEEDS BONGOCAT RESTART

# Animation settings
# idle_frame: Which frame to use when idle (0, 1, or 2)

# Options for dm: 0 = idle 1, 1 = idle 2

# Sleep Mode settings
# enable_scheduled_sleep: When set to 1, the system will pause animations and display the sleep screen

# Optional, use fps as fallback

# test_animation_duration: How long to show test animation (in milliseconds)

#DEPRECATED: use animation_speed (for non-bongocat)

# test_animation_interval: How often to trigger test animation (in seconds)
# Set to 0 to disable test animations

#DEPRECATED: use idle_animation and animation_speed (for non-bongocat)

# Frame rate settings
# fps: Animation frame rate (frames per second)
fps=15

# Transparency settings
# overlay_opacity: Opacity of the overlay background (0-255)

# Use wlr-randr or swaymsg -t get_outputs to find monitor names
# If not specified or monitor not found, uses first available monitor
