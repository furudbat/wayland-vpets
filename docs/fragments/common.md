# DESCRIPTION

**Bongo Cat Wayland Overlay** is a Wayland compositor overlay that displays
animated sets, including the classic Bongo Cat, Digimon, and Pok√©mon. It reacts
to keyboard input or system state, adding a playful, interactive pet on your
screen.

The program is lightweight, configurable, and can be toggled on or off at
runtime. Multiple assets are embedded.

By default, configuration is read from `bongocat.conf` in the current directory.
You can override this with `--config`. Hot-reloading is supported with
`--watch-config`.
